## Breadth First over array alternative

This is an example code of detecting adjacent 1s (horisontally and vertically) in a bidimensional array. This example is to check if their are better approaches to solve such problem other than (or better than) using Breadth First algorithm.

## USAGE

In your terminal type 

    $ python bfs_over_array_alt.py array1 array2

where array1 and array2 are example bidimensional array format

Accepted formats examples are:

    $ python bfs_over_array_alt.py 1,1,0,1,0,0,1 1,0,1,1,1,0,1
    $ python bfs_over_array_alt.py [1,1,0,1,0,0,1] [1,0,1,1,1,0,1]

Note: if you are using Pyhon V3 then, in replace command 'python' with 'python3'
